Read ../_bisdev/CLAUDE.md first.

## Layout (BiSGuild only)

- `BiSGuild.toc`: the load order and the only place the version lives (`## Version`). It also carries
  `## X-Curse-Project-ID` (0 until the CurseForge project exists) and `## X-CurseForge-GameVersionType`,
  which `dev/release.ps1` reads.
- `Core/Init.lua`: the house skeleton from `_bisdev/new-addon.sh` — palette per call (`ns.T`), `ns.VERSION`
  from the TOC, `ns.Print`, `BiSGuildDB` defaults, the shared BiS channel booted with its off switch saved,
  and `/bisg` (a hello to replace with the real addon).
- `Libs/`: embedded `BiSTheme/Console.lua` and `LibBiSComm-1.0` — copies, see `../_bisdev/CLAUDE.md`.
- `dev/tests.lua`: headless suite on `dev/kit.lua` (Nebbinator's strict harness, verbatim). Loads the TOC's
  files in order, fails on any global not in `ALLOWED`. `dev/theme.lua`: the palette law.
- `dev/release.ps1`: zip + CurseForge upload (normally GitHub runs it on a tag — see
  `../_bisdev/docs/playbook.md`).
- `.github/workflows/check.yml` (every push/PR) and `release.yml` (tag = release, PR = dry run).
