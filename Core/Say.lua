  BiSGuild :: Core/Say.lua - reading the record back.

  A number nobody can check is a number nobody should act on, so every line here can be opened up:
  the percentage, then the nights behind it, then the kills behind those. The first argument a
  council has will be somebody saying "that is not right" - and they will be right often enough
  that the addon has to be able to show its working.
