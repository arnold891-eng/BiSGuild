-- BiSGuild :: Core/Build.lua - written by Tools\stamp.ps1. Never edit it by hand.
--
-- What this copy says it is. Every file of ours ends by writing its version into ns.parts, and
-- Core/Copies.lua checks them against this list at login: a file missing, failing to load, or
-- left over from another version, and BiS Guild says so and stops. The fingerprint is the
-- SHA-256 of Tools/manifest.txt. This file is not inside it (it holds it); logreport.ps1 checks
-- instead that it is exactly this text and nothing else.
